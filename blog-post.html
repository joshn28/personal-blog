                <p class="border-bottom"><em>Gratitude is a powerful emotion that can transform your life in ways you never thought possible.</em> By practicing gratitude daily, you can train your brain to focus on the positive aspects of your life, which can lead to increased <b>happiness, improved relationships, and a more positive outlook on life</b>.</p>
                <p class="border-bottom"><em>To start a daily gratitude practice, all you need is a journal and a few minutes each day.</em> Each morning, write down three things you're grateful for, and why you're grateful for them. This simple act can help you reframe your mindset, and shift your focus away from what you don't have, and towards what you do have.</p>
                <p class="border-bottom"><em>Over time, you'll start to notice a shift in your mood, and a greater sense of happiness and contentment in your life.</em> You may also find that you're more appreciative of the people and things in your life, and that you're better able to cope with challenges and setbacks.</p>
